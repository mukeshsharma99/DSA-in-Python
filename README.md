## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Data Structures
- Arrays / Lists
- Stacks
- Queues (Simple, Circular, Priority)
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Hash Tables / Dictionaries
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)
- Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency List / Matrix)
- Sets

### 🔹 Algorithms

- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)
- Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
